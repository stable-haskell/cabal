description: {

  This change allows the `build-type: Configure` field to be used in
  Cabal packages in conjunction with components. (E.g. public sublibraries).
  This is a significant change as it enables the use of the `Configure` build
  type, which cabal bailed on previously.

  This does change the behaviour of cabal-install for packages that contain
  `build-type: Configure`. We now always build them as components with
  cabal-install.  Previously we would turn packages with main libraries, and
  executables/benchmarks/tests-suites into a single package to be built in a
  compatibility mode.  This is no longer the case.
