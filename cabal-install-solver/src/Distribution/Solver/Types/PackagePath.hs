    -- By rights setup dependencies ought to be nestable; after all, the setup
    -- dependencies of a package might themselves have setup dependencies, which
    -- are independent from everything else. However, this very quickly leads to
    -- infinite search trees in the solver. Therefore we limit ourselves to
    -- a single qualifier (within a given namespace).
  | QualSetup PackageName

    -- | If we depend on an executable from a package (via
    -- @build-tools@), we should solve for the dependencies of that
    -- package separately (since we're not going to actually try to
    -- link it.)  We qualify for EACH package separately; e.g.,
    -- @'Exe' pn1 pn2@ qualifies the @build-tools@ dependency on
    -- @pn2@ from package @pn1@.  (If we tracked only @pn1@, that
    -- would require a consistent dependency resolution for all
    -- of the depended upon executables from a package; if we
    -- tracked only @pn2@, that would require us to pick only one
    -- version of an executable over the entire install plan.)
